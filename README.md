# multiplication-algorithms
&emsp; Advanced algorithm 1st session assignment for comparing and implementing multiplication algorithms. Here we implemented three multiplication algorithms:
- Multiplication via repeated addition
- Grade school (standard)
- Karatsuba

And we compare their time on different numbers multiplication. As the results show, Karatsuba works better on large numbers multiplication.
