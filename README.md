# multiplication-algorithms
&emsp; Advanced algorithm 1st session assignment for comparing and implementing multiplication algorithms for numbers and matrices.
### numbers multiplications:<br/>
&emsp; Here we implemented three multiplication algorithms:
- Multiplication via repeated addition
- Grade school (standard)
- Karatsuba

And we compare their time on different numbers multiplication. As the results show, Karatsuba works better on large numbers multiplication.
<br/>
### matrix multiplications:<br/>
&emsp; Here we implemented two multiplication algorithms for matrix:
- simple way
- strassen
- strassen2 (different recursive condition)

As we can see strasse2 hav has the best time. But in comparison with strasses and simple way, as we increase matrix size, we expect strassen to work better, but we don't get 
this result because we need to increase matrix size more but the time it needs to run the program, grows and we couldn't continue increasing size. But the strassen2, works 
better than simple way even at the beginning.
